## Response from Mukta S. Aphale
***I have completed the exercise as per the instructions.  

	*Extended the person model in the data assembly to include some properties: id, first name, last name, date of birth 
	*Removed the original home component. 
	*Added person-form person-list components in the folder called persons 
	*Added some CSS styling for visual design 
	*The app does the following: 
		-Displays a list of people – Initial data is seeded at the start of the application 
		-In-memory database is used 
		-Allows the selected person to be loaded into the editor 
		-Allows addition, editing and deletion of people 
		-Id cannot be edited.  
		-Edited people can be saved in the in-memory DB 
		-Deleted people are removed from the in-memory DB 
		-Form can be cleared using “Clear Form” button 
	*I have made sure that functions in the PersonService (C# and Angular both) class are small and unit-testable 
	*The PersonController class will catch exceptions and give BadRequest message if required. 
	*I have also added some C# and Angular unit tests. 
	*Dependency Injection is used for using PersonService class into the PersonController. 
	*Using PersonViewModel and Person classes to separate UI logic and business logic.
